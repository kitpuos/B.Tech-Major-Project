# B.Tech-Major-Project
This repository contains all the relevant files, codes and results of the final year project I worked on

This project dives deep into the topic of Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) with the aim to detect and identify various malicious software and the family it belongs to.
This study looks into how XAI methods in association with machine learning models can improve malware detection and family identification.
A large diverse dataset has been taken into consideration consisting of various kinds of hash values and entropy measures among the features.
For dealing with the hashes, a hash-encoding algorithm has been proposed.
An effective feature selection using the Boruta algorithm is performed to extract the best features.
Standard classification machine learning models have been implemented to distinguish and classify between malware and benignware, with Random Forest (RF) producing the best results.
XAI methods have been utilised for model explainability and accountability.
Clustering methods have also been utilised to identify and cluster different malicious samples into their respective families and also identify potential zero-day malware in the process.
